This repo is a fork of Open WebUI. I want to deploy this as an instance in my companies aws account so my employees can have a shared space to create ai agents, company wide knoweledge base and choose from a variaty of hosted models. I have keys to access the OpenAI API, Anthropic, and Gemini that I can provide if you tell me where to put them. Use Context7 mcp tool to determine the best way to deploy this to aws. I want it to be exposed to ai.technologymatch.com

Some notes:
I want to plan for a peak load of 20 people using the app between 7am-6pm EST M-F
I want to have monitoring so i can see who is application and when. insights on how each person is using it is important.
